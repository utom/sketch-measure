# A new feature for Sketch Measure: Export Layer's influence Rect to Spec.

Layer's influence rect includes the area of shadows and outside borders, it's exactly the same size with the exported image.

                                       Regular rect                                                           Influence rect

Sometime, shadows will not implement by engineers, it should be a part of image. Designer need to show the influence rect to engineers, not the regular rect. This is the feature using for.

Just select the option in Export UI
